This is the game I made for my second ever competition, and first ever game jam. The theme was "Duality". (It was Global Game Jam 2022)<br>
It's a rhythm game inspired by Beat Saber where you have 2 lanes you can go to and you have to hit black and white notes. Black notes can only be hit with the black sword and white notes can only be hit with the white sword.<br>
Features:
- 2 lanes, 2 swords
- Gameplay that's synchronized with the music
- A pretty useful chart editor (we made like 6 song charts during the jam)
- Charts that are made are stored as JSON files and can be shared along with the music file
- Normal and hold notes
- A score counting algorithm
- Highscore saving system<br>

We tried to include "slide" notes (where you can start holding in one lane and then switch to another), but it wasn't a fun feature so we removed it<br>
I'm really proud of what I did with this game, even though it is a little buggy at times.
